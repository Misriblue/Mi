          <strong> The rock-hewn churches of Lalibela </strong>in Ethiopia are
          extraordinary for their unique construction, carved directly from
          solid rock in the 12th century by King Lalibela to create a "New
          Jerusalem". These 11 monolithic churches, interconnected by a
          labyrinth of tunnels and passageways, feature intricate designs and
          symbolic layouts representing biblical locations. Highlights include
          the Church of Saint George (Bete Giyorgis) with its iconic
          cross-shaped design, and the richly decorated interiors with ancient
          carvings and frescoes. As a UNESCO World Heritage Site, Lalibela
          attracts over 50,000 tourists annually, serving as an active
          pilgrimage destination and a testament to medieval Ethiopian
          craftsmanship, spiritual devotion, and cultural heritage. This
          remarkable site continues to inspire awe and reverence among visitors
          from around the world. It took 24 years to build all the 11 rock hewn
          churches.
